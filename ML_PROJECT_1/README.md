# Coding Samurai Internship Task - Flower Species Prediction

![Iris Flowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_%28plant%29)

This repository contains the solution for the Coding Samurai Internship Task, where the goal is to create a machine learning model to predict the species of iris flowers based on their measurements. The project utilizes the famous Iris dataset and follows a step-by-step process, including data collection, exploration, preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Project Overview

- **Data Collection:** The Iris dataset, sourced from scikit-learn, is used for building and evaluating the model. The dataset includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different species of iris flowers.

- **Data Exploration:** Visualizations and exploratory data analysis (EDA) are performed to understand the structure of the dataset and relationships between features.

- **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values, encoding the categorical target variable (species), and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

- **Model Selection:** A Logistic Regression model is chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in classification tasks.

- **Model Training:** The selected model is trained using the training dataset.

- **Model Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1-score.

- **Prediction:** The trained model is used to make predictions on new data points.

- **Visualization:** Confusion matrices and other visualizations are created to understand the model's performance.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Coding-Samurai-Internship-Task.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to explore, preprocess, train, and evaluate the model.

## Additional Notes

- This project serves as a hands-on task for the Coding Samurai Internship, providing practical experience in machine learning and data science.

- Feel free to experiment with hyperparameter tuning, additional algorithms, or other enhancements to improve the model.
